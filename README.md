This repo is for the Take Home Assignment 

The NASA Gallery App displays a grid of photos that relate to the theme of space. Each photo can be viewed in detail with zoom alongside information depicting the elements of the photo. 

The app has a beautiful app icon that has been handcrafted to reflect the theme of the content inside.

## Extra Features

To make the app experience even more meaningful, I have added *two new features*-


## Feature Highlights
- Lazy loaded grid of all available photos
- Detail view where users can view information, date, favourite or even share a photo. Users can also zoom and swipe between photos and drag down to dismiss
- The Favorites View shows only the photos that are marked as favorites. Users can also view a slide show of just their favorite photos. 
- The Slide show option shows all the photos with beautiful transitions and accompanying music
- Haptic feedback across the app

## Tech
- The app has been fully built with SwiftUI 
- I have used the MVVM architecture to ensure separation of concerns
- I have added appropriate unit tests to test out the business logic
- I have used Core Data (to store and retrieve Favorites) and image caching to handle image load across the app


Please check out the screenshots

I had a lot of fun sketching and building out a feature-rich product experience for this app. 

Hoping to hear from you soon!
